The spectra in this folder are taken from a MobileDoas traverse
at Manam volcano.

FLMS14634.clb contains an initial pixel-to-wavelength calibration for the measured spectrum.
    However, this is very far off in the longer wavelength range of the spectrum - giving very large
    initial errors in the calibration.
